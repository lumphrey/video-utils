This script is a utility for splitting or concatenating video files using ffmpeg. It accepts command-line arguments to specify the start time for trimming (--from), the duration to trim from the end (--trim-end), and whether to keep all output files (--keep-all-files). The script collects files from the current directory that match a specific pattern (join\d+__.*\.mp4), creates a list of files to concatenate, and then uses ffmpeg to concatenate them into a single output file. If trimming is specified, it also trims the output file accordingly. Finally, it renames processed files and cleans up the directory based on the command-line arguments provided.
